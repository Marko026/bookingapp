# Product Guidelines

## Core Philosophy
- **Technical Excellence:** The primary driver is elevating code quality to "Context7" standards.
- **Best Practices:** Strict adherence to modern design patterns, type safety, and architectural consistency.
- **Modernization:** Leveraging the latest ecosystem features (Next.js 16, React 19) effectively.

## User Experience (UX)
- **Performance First:** Updates must prioritize application speed and responsiveness.
- **Stability:** Refactoring must maintain or improve current system reliability.

## Visual Design
- **Immutable Design:** **DO NOT** change the existing visual design, layout, or aesthetics.
- **Preservation:** All refactoring must strictly preserve the current look and feel (Shadcn UI + Tailwind).

## Development Standards
- **Context7:** Utilize Context7 context for all architectural and code style decisions.
- **MCP Patterns:** Implement Model Context Protocol patterns where applicable.
