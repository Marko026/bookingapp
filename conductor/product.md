# Product Guide: Sanctuary Booking App

## Initial Concept
The Sanctuary Booking App is a luxury-grade rental platform designed to allow any visitor to easily book a stay at the "Sanctuary" apartments. The project is currently in a mature state. The primary objective is to fix the internationalization workflow for dynamic content.

## Target Audience
- **Prospective Guests:** Any visitor to the website who wishes to view apartment details and make a reservation.
- **Administrators:** Property owners managing listings, bookings, and content, who primarily speak Serbian.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Seamless Booking:** A frictionless, intuitive interface for checking availability and securing a reservation.
- **Reliable Management:** Robust tools for admins to manage content and bookings without data inconsistencies.
- **Correct Internationalization:** Ensuring all content entered in Serbian is correctly accessible and displayed to English-speaking users.

## Key Features (Current Focus)
- **Apartment Listings:** Detailed views with image galleries, pricing, and descriptions.
- **Booking Engine:** Real-time availability checks and reservation management.
- **Internationalization:** Support for Serbian and English (resolving missing translations for database content).
- **Admin Dashboard:** Tools for managing apartments, bookings, and attractions.

## Immediate Goals
- **Fix Content Internationalization:** Implement a solution for handling multilingual content (Descriptions/Titles) for Apartments and Attractions. Investigate Next.js i18n patterns to allow Serbian input to be effectively used for the English locale (whether via automated local tools or improved data structure), ensuring English users see intelligible descriptions.
